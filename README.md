#### Description ðŸ“ƒ

A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. In our current release, there are 1200 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images, and 1345 viral pneumonia images. We will continue to update this database as soon as we have new x-ray images for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

#### ResNet50 architecture 

 We using to ResNet50 architecture as a model for this case, we were thought about this architecture applied a medical image replacing some layers and make a fine tuning in this model. We've put a new layers and some made changes in the architecture by the way when come up needs in our project and fiting for the final architecture for solution.

 #### AI application ðŸ“±
 
 It's a gif that shows the final application done in this project, a web app created by streamlit framework who be able the doctor sees the real diagnostic on pacient x-ray.
